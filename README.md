# Traffic Simulation Adjuster

https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/76836/Windows

**Disclaimer**: This is currently a WIP because the settings pane isn't done so there isn't any actual adjustment, along with it only changing TrafficReduction.
		
Currently only disables the restriction that reduces how much traffic spawns the bigger the city gets. A performance hit is to be expected. An adjustment option is in the works.

Thanks to algernon and Infixo for the help and mxdanger for the idea.
