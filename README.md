# Traffic Simulation Adjuster

https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/76836/Windows

**Disclaimer**: This is currently a WIP because, for now, it only changes the traffic reduction coefficient.

Allows you to adjust the coefficient for traffic reduction, changing to what extent traffic is reduced in a larger city.
0 is no reduction, and would have a considerable hit to performance. 4 is the vanilla setting, and 10 is increased traffic reduction.

Thanks to algernon and Infixo for the help and mxdanger for the idea.
